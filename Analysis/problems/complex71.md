This problem sucks. I didn't get it on the exam and I doubt I could get it on the qual unless the original hint about the contour was there. I guess the tip-off is that the integral is over the real line and not over a contour in the complex plane. Still, exams make the brain go cloudy and I might not get that and thus be unable to even apply the problem hypothesis. Pray for me.
