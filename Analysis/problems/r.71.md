oh god it's an absolute continuity question. definitely is going to be on there. I think I could get b so long as I didn't forget what an F-sigma set is. COMPACT!

part a is definitely stumbleable. (this is a good thing, it means I can stumble my way through it) the closed set giving the inequality is a little creative. though if I get that I may be able to do it, but not as carefully about the infinite sums.
