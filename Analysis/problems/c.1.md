Really more of a countability argument than anything else, though again the fact that analytic functions have isolated zeros is important. This also shows as a corollary that nonzero analytic functions have countably many zeros; this is due to each f^(n) itself being an analytic function. Substituting any other analytic function leads to exactly the same proof as in the second paragraph.
