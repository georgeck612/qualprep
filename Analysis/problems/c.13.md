The first line about writing f(z) as e^w for some complex w falls out from Picard's little theorem, as e^z is entire and whose range is the complex plane minus the origin. The machinery involved in the proof doesn't really come to me naturally, but the idea makes sense; take a derivative to show something is constant, then showing that constant is 1. I don't think I could do this on a qual in a reasonable amount of time, unless there was a hint about g(z) maybe.
