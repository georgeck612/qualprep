it's all cantor set, baby

I want to say more words about why the limit turns into the interval minus the sum, but the way it is now is confident enough and shows enough easy steps that maybe it'll be clear I get the point. unless raul decides to be a stickler :(

also I was very vague about the half open interval thing and the issue with .99999... and all that. I don't think it would cost me points on the qual. maybe a couple. I should fix this so it's complete. please do that future george
