This one isn't bad once I got the general idea of it. It's very elementary, which makes me a little scared because that normally means a little bit of ingenuity is required, which I might not have on the qual. Here specifically, I could figure it out after proving that a matrix with a single nonzero element was in the ideal, but I am not sure about getting that idea in the first place. Might be that it's a generally useful technique; getting more of these ones written down is good for me.
